# EduQA-Chatbot

A Transformer-Based Question Answering Chatbot for Educational Applications

## 📘 Overview

EduQA-Chatbot is a transformer-based chatbot system designed to enhance educational interactions through natural language understanding and contextual response generation. It integrates advanced NLP models like DistilBERT to provide relevant, real-time answers to user queries. This project focuses on improving chatbot quality using novel evaluation metrics and ethical AI practices.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a context-aware chatbot using transformer models.
- Improve user interaction using metrics like emotional resonance and user satisfaction.
- Mitigate biases and enhance fairness in responses.
- Optimize for real-time deployment and interaction.

## 🔍 Key Features

- Transformer-based NLP model (DistilBERT).
- Evaluation metrics beyond accuracy: emotional relevance, engagement, response diversity.
- Bias mitigation strategies.
- Simple text-based web GUI.
- Domain adaptability (Education, Customer Service, Healthcare).

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- HuggingFace Transformers (DistilBERT)
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm
- Web GUI (CLI interface for testing)

## 📂 Dataset

A custom-curated dataset including user queries from the educational domain, labeled intents, and feedback-based metrics. It includes:

- Session context
- Timestamp metadata
- User feedback (satisfaction scores)

## ⚙️ Model Architecture

- **Transformer Core**: DistilBERT-based QA model.
- **Context Management**: Seq2Seq attention mechanism for dialogue flow.
- **Bias Detection**: Counterfactual Data Augmentation techniques.
- **Performance Optimization**: Knowledge distillation + caching.
