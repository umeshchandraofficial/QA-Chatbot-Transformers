ZT-11 Question Answering Chatbot using Transformers:

This code implements a transformer-based Question Answering (QA) chatbot system that allows users to interact with it via a graphical interface to ask questions related to the content of a predefined document. The system utilizes the transformers library, integrating a pre-trained DistilBERT model for Natural Language Processing tasks. The chatbot provides contextual answers to user questions and supports basic conversational interactions.

Key Components

1. Model Setup:
Pre-trained Model: The DistilBERT model distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad, fine-tuned for question answering on the SQuAD dataset, is used.
Tokenizer: The DistilBertTokenizer encodes user questions and the context into a format suitable for model input.
Model Loading: The pre-trained DistilBertForQuestionAnswering is loaded to perform start and end span prediction tasks.

2. Question Answering Function:
Function: answer_question takes a question and a context string as inputs.
Process:
Encodes the question and context into token IDs using the tokenizer.
Feeds the tokenized data to the model for inference.
Extracts the start and end logits from the model output to identify the span of text in the context that answers the question.
Decodes the predicted token IDs back to human-readable text.
Output: Returns the extracted answer.

3. Context Loading:
The code reads a text file (company xyz.txt) containing the context information about "company xyz mattresses." This context is used to answer user queries.

4. Chatbot Logic:
Function: chatbot_response processes user inputs to simulate conversational behavior.
Predefined Responses:
Greetings like "hello" and "hi" prompt a welcome message.
Farewell phrases like "thank you" and "bye" prompt a polite closure message.
QA Integration: For all other inputs, the function passes the user question and the document context to the answer_question function for generating responses.

5. User Interface:
Library: gradio is used to build a web-based graphical interface.
Interface Components:
Input: A text box where users can type their questions.
Output: Text output displaying the chatbot's response.
Interface Attributes:
Title: "Question Answering Chatbot using Transformers."
Description: A brief description of the chatbot's purpose.
Theme: Customized using the "huggingface" theme.

6. Application Launch:
The Gradio interface is launched locally, allowing users to interact with the chatbot in real-time.

User Flow:
Input: Users ask a question about "company xyz mattresses" via the text input box.
Processing:
For casual greetings or farewells, predefined responses are returned.
For questions, the system processes the input and uses the DistilBERT model to extract relevant answers from the loaded document context.
Output: The chatbot displays the generated answer or predefined response to the user.


Conclusion
This code implements a simple yet effective QA chatbot that combines state-of-the-art NLP techniques with a user-friendly interface. It demonstrates the potential of transformer models like DistilBERT in creating responsive and accurate conversational systems for domain-specific applications such as customer support.
